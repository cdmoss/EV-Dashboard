##### How much does it cost to charge the e-golf?

Using a rate of 12.8 cents/kWh and the  or \$2.15 for a full charge.

Public charging stations are often free, but some charge a flat rate or cost per kWh that is comparable to the cost of charging at home.

##### What maintenance do electric vehicles require?

Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, fuel filter replacements, spark plug replacements or emission checks, but still will require regular maintenance of the brakes, tires, coolant and of course the battery.

<br>



##### What type of warranty does the e-golf have?

The warranty for the e-golf is as follows:

- Bumper to bumper coverage for 4 years or 80,000 km
- Powertrain limited warranty for 5 years or 100,000 km
- Corrosion Perforation warranty for 7 years, no kilometer limit
- High voltage system warranty for 5 years or 100,000 km

As per the iZEV program, the Canadian Federal Government will award rebates for the following amounts (pertaining to the 2019 VW E-golf):

 - \$5,000 for full purchase 
 - \$1,250 for a 12-month lease 
 - \$2,500 for a 24-month lease 
 - \$3,750 for a 36-month lease

#### Charging {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-dropdown}

##### How long does it take to charge on average?

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
b = chargetimes %>% 
  summarise(averageChargeRate = mean(chargetimes$`Charge rate (kWh/min)`),
            minChargeRate = min(chargetimes$`Charge rate (kWh/min)`),
            maxChargeRate = max(chargetimes$`Charge rate (kWh/min)`)
            )

low = b %>% pull(averageChargeRate) %>% signif(2)
high = b %>% pull(maxChargeRate) %>% signif(2)
avg = b %>% pull(averageChargeRate) %>% signif(2)
```

There are 3 levels of charger:

- Level 1 (110V-120V): full charge takes 26 - 29hrs

- Level 2 (208V-240V): From 33 charges in our dataset using a Flo X2 level 2 home charger, the average charge rate was `r avg` kWh/min, the lowest charge time was `r low`, and the highest charge rate was `r high`. The E-golf battery capacity is 35.8kWh, meaning the average theoretical full charge time is 5 hours, the longest charge time is 8.5hrs and the quickest charge time is 3.5hrs

- Level 3 (400V+): full charge takes 30-45min

##### What are the options for home charging stations and how much do they cost?

The E-golf comes with a charger that is capable of level 1 charging from a 110V outlet.

<br>

Aftermarket charging stations from companies like Flo or ChargePoint are also available, which offer features such as faster charging than a wall outlet alone, longer charging cord, warranty and smartphone compatibility.

![<strong>(The Flo Home X5 level 2 charger allows for smartphone connectivity and<br> can send usage data such as length of charge and power usage.)</strong>](https://store.flo.ca/content/images/thumbs/0000319_flo-home-x5_550.jpeg)


##### Which chargers are compatible with the e-golf?

The E-golf supports both J1772 standard and CCS technologies, which allows the vehicle to be charged using level 1, 2 (standard) and 3 (CCS) connectors.

[Plugshare](https://www.plugshare.com/) is a great web application that shows every charging station across the globe and allows filtering for plug designs, charging networks, payment requirements and more.

##### How much does the e-golf cost to drive ($/km)?

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x = 41.55/655

val = df %>% 
  mutate(cost = economy * x,
         cost = cost / 100) %>% 
  summarise(CostPerKm = mean(cost, na.rm = T) %>% scales::dollar()) %>% 
  pull(CostPerKm)
```
From our data, the average cost per km is `r val`.

##### What is energy recuperation?

When the vehicle is braked, and when the vehicle is coasting, electrical energy is generated via the electric motor and storwd in the high-voltage battery. This feature is called brake energy recuperation.

##### How fast is the e-golf?

Relevant specs of the e-golf are as follows:

Top speed: 150 km/h.

Time to accelerate from 0 - 100 km/h: 9.6 seconds

Instantaneous torque: 214 lb-ft (270 Nm)

##### What are the drive modes?

The drive modes change the way the e-golf consumes power:

Normal: Uses normal drivetrain and air conditioning power consumption. The full power of the electric motor is available. Maximum speed is reduced to 140km/h.

Eco: Energy consumption is reduced compared to the Normal driving mode. The power of the electric motor is reduced compared to the normal driving mode. Climatronic<sup>1</sup> heating and cooling is optimized for consumption. Maximum speed is reduced to 120km/h.

Eco-Plus: The power of the electric motor is reduced beyond that of Eco mode. Climatronic<sup>1</sup> heating and cooling is disabled, but defrost and ventilation are still available. Maximum speed is reduced to 95 km/h.

<br>

1. Climatronic refers to the vehicle's automatic climate control function, which allows the internal temperature to be set at a certain degree value.

##### How does temperature affect the range of the e-golf?

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = start_outside_temp, y = range_start)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.15) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Range")

```

According to our data (shown above), the predicted range of the e-golf increases as temperature increases.
