# EV-Dashboard

This is a data dashboard made using R and Shiny to display the results of a project conducted by the Medicine Hat College and Southland Volkswagon, in which several people test drove a 2019 Volkswagon E-Golf and recorded various data as well as their subjective feelings of the driving experience. 

The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://advancement-mhc.shinyapps.io/EVDB/).
