I want to learn about the economy of the car.

- What is the average economy accross the dataset?
  - Average Economy = 21.22749 Kwh/100km

- What is the average economy for each drive mode?
  - E = 24.8
  - E?+ = 18.9 
  - N = 21.2
  - N?E = 18.1

- What about brake modes?
  - 0 = 21.3
  - B = 16.3
  - D1 = 24.6
  - D2 = 18.4
  - D3 = 19.0
  
- Drivers
  - 1 = 22.6
  - 2 = 26.8
  - 3 = 18.6
  - 4 = 16.3
  - 5 = na
  - 6 = 15.7
  - 7 = 13.7
  - 8 = na
  - 9 = 13.9
  
- Road Style
  - City = 22.2
  - City/Highway = 21.2
  - Highway = 20.4

- number of occupants
  - 1 = 21.5
  - 2 = 18.9
  - 3 = 20.6
  - 4 = 31.5
  - strange, but probably due to skewed data

How accurate is the economy report?
- Sum the distance driven for each charge
- divide the power used each charge by the distance sum

Figure out how power used/min is affected
